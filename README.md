## 🔄 State Management

The application uses React Context API for state management:

### AuthContext
- User authentication state
- Login/logout functionality
- Role-based access control

### AppContext
- Patient data management
- Appointment/incident data
- File storage and retrieval
- Dashboard analytics

## 💾 Data Persistence

All data is stored in `localStorage` to simulate a backend:

### Storage Structure
```javascript
{
  "users": [...],           // User authentication data
  "patients": [...],        // Patient records
  "incidents": [...],       // Appointments and treatments
  "files": [...],          // Uploaded files (base64 encoded)
  "currentUser": {...}     // Current session data
}
```

### File Storage
- Files are converted to base64 strings for localStorage compatibility
- Blob URLs are generated for file preview and download
- Maximum file size limited to prevent localStorage overflow

## 🔐 Authentication

### Implementation Details
- Simulated authentication with hardcoded users
- JWT-like token simulation using localStorage
- Role-based route protection
- Session persistence across browser refreshes

### Security Considerations
- Frontend-only authentication (simulation)
- No actual password encryption (demo purposes)
- Role-based access control at component level

## 🎨 Technical Decisions

### Framework Choice
- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and extensive ecosystem
- **Functional Components**: Used throughout for better performance and modern React practices
- **React Router**: Implemented for client-side routing with protected routes

### Styling Approach
- **TailwindCSS**: Selected for rapid development and consistent design system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-based styling
- **Component Library**: Custom components built with Tailwind for consistency

### State Management
- **Context API**: Chosen over Redux for simpler state management needs
- **Local Storage**: Used for data persistence without backend complexity
- **Custom Hooks**: Implemented for reusable logic and cleaner components

### File Handling
- **Base64 Encoding**: Used for storing files in localStorage
- **File Size Limits**: Implemented to prevent browser storage issues
- **Type Validation**: Added for security and user experience

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **LocalStorage Limitations**
   - Storage size limitations may cause issues with large file uploads
   - Data persistence only within the same browser/device

2. **File Upload Constraints**
   - Large files may cause performance issues
   - Limited file type validation on frontend only

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Some complex tables may require horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
   - Calendar view optimization for very small screens

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Modern browser features used (may not support very old browsers)
   - localStorage dependency requires JavaScript enabled

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements
- Enhanced file upload with progress indicators
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Export functionality for reports and data
- Email notification simulation

### Long-term Features
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external calendar systems
- Offline capability with service workers

### Technical Improvements
- Unit and integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance)
- TypeScript migration
